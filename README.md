###Description
Don't Slack is an application created for user's to gain focus through their daily tasks.
In this application, users can mainly create tasks, set a start time and a deadline to time themselves and feel 
accomplished upon completion. 

###Features
Some of our main features include:
    - Add tasks
    - Set start time and deadline
    - Create Notes
    - Set Events on Calendar

##Target Audience
Our application mainly targets students who seek a study buddy who can help them focus
through their daily school tasks. With a start time and deadline set, students would be able 
to track their progress and manage their time wisely. 

But other than students, our application allows users to categorise their tasks according
to Work and Personal tasks. This way, our target audience extends to not just students, but to working adults, 
seniors and of course, to the procrastinators.
